# 🤖 Hugging Face NLP Experiments

Welcome to my **Hugging Face NLP Experiments** repository! This repo is a playground where I tinker with **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using Hugging Face's powerful transformer models. Here, you'll find a collection of experiments, scripts, and insights into various NLP tasks.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

- **📄 Text Classification:**  
  Implementations for various text classification tasks using models like **DistilBERT**, **BERT**, and **RoBERTa**. This includes fine-tuning and testing on datasets like IMDB, SST-2, etc.

- **📝 Text Generation:**  
  Exploring generative models like **GPT-2** and **T5** for generating text based on prompts or tasks like summarization and translation.

- **🔍 Named Entity Recognition (NER):**  
  Experiments with models to detect entities (like names, places, etc.) from raw text using pre-trained models like **BERT-NER**.

- **💬 Sentiment Analysis:**  
  Analyzing the sentiment of text using Hugging Face models, including fine-tuning for custom sentiment datasets.

- **⚙️ Tokenization:**  
  Understanding and experimenting with different tokenization techniques using Hugging Face’s `tokenizers` library.

## 📚 Key Features

- **Pre-trained Transformer Models:**  
  Harnessing the power of state-of-the-art models like **BERT**, **GPT-2**, **DistilBERT**, and others from Hugging Face.

- **Fine-Tuning:**  
  Custom fine-tuning scripts to adapt pre-trained models for specific downstream tasks.

- **Custom Datasets:**  
  Integration of custom datasets using Hugging Face's `datasets` library for experiments beyond popular benchmarks.

- **Evaluation:**  
  Evaluation metrics and performance tracking for different NLP models across various tasks.
